It is now facing a number of different headwinds, including the prospect of higher taxes and a warning from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30 percent in the event of a disorderly exit from the European Union. More specifically, four overlooked cracks suggest that the London market may be in worse shape than many realize: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder exodus and tax hikes addressing overseas buyers of homes in England and Wales."

            "source": "<p> To sum up, according to Bloomberg News, the London Housing Market is in a rut. It is now facing a number of different headwinds, including the prospect of higher taxes and a warning from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30 percent in the event of a disorderly exit from the European Union. In this scenario, it is urgent to adopt machine learning tools in order to assist homebuyers clientele in London to make wise and effective decisions. As a result, the business problem we were posing was: how could we provide support to homebuyers clientele in to purchase a suitable real estate in London in this uncertain economic and financial scenario?\n\nTo solve this business problem, we clustered London neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where homebuyers can make a real estate investment. We recommended profitable venues according to amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores.\n\nFirst, we gathered data on London properties and the relative price paid data were extracted from the HM Land Registry (http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/). Moreover, to explore and target recommended locations across different venues according to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we accessed data through FourSquare API interface and arranged them as a data frame for visualization. By merging data on London properties and the relative price paid data from the HM Land Registry and data on amenities and essential facilities surrounding such properties from FourSquare API interface, we were able to recommend profitable real estate investments.\n\nSecond, The Methodology section comprised four stages: 1. Collect Inspection Data; 2. Explore and Understand Data; 3. Data preparation and preprocessing; 4. Modeling. In particular, in the modeling section, we used the k-means clustering technique as it is fast and efficient in terms of computational cost, is highly flexible to account for mutations in real estate market in London and is accurate.\n\nFinally, we drew the conclusion that even though the London Housing Market may be in a rut, it is still an \"ever-green\" for business affairs. We discussed our results under two main perspectives. First, we examined them according to neighborhoods/London areas. although West London (Notting Hill, Kensington, Chelsea, Marylebone) and North-West London (Hampsted) might be considered highly profitable venues to purchase a real estate according to amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores, South-West London (Wandsworth, Balham) and North-West London (Isliington) are arising as next future elite venues with a wide range of amenities and facilities. Accordingly, one might target under-priced real estates in these areas of London in order to make a business affair. Second, we analyzed our results according to the five clusters we produced.
